## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
data <- read.csv('GraphingData.csv')
print(data)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
library("plotly")

 ggplot(data, aes(Accuracy, factor(Category))) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", colour = "red", size = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 3)) +
   theme(axis.title.y=element_blank(),)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
