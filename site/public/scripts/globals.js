Hello, and welcome to Assignment 3. Your job is to help me perform an experiment in deciding which
data visualization method is most effective. Specifically, you will see 20 different visualizations
per visualization type: pie chart, vertical bar chart and horizontal bar chart. If 60 visualizations
seems like a lot to analyze, I've tried to make the process as streamlined as possible. You will be shown
1 visualization at a time with two data points highlighted using black dots. Your job is to give an estimate
what percent the smaller data point is than the larger data point. So if you think one data point is half as
big as the other you'd type in a 50 in the input field. To move onto the next visualization you'll just hit
the enter key on your keyboard.
