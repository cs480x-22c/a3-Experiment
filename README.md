Experiment- We are testing the effectiveness of perceiving different visualizations of data- bar chart, pie chart, and circle chart.
In the experiment, we generate random numbers, 5 random numbers between 0 and 100

Each visualization represents the data points in  different ways:

Bar chart- height of the bars
Pie chart- area of the pie
Circle chart- radius of the circle

During the experimment, we labeled each of the sections with letters
In a random order, we show each participant the visualizations and have them guess in percentages the difference between two outlined sections.

Design choice- made visualizations black and white to make it easier to see and distinguish which sections to compare.

We only decided to show them one trial at a time because we did not want to lose our participant's focus. 
Since we did not want to show the charts repeatedly, we have the option for the participant to take the trials again as many times as they would like for flexibility by easily reloading the page.

As far as implementation was concerned, cookie code was based off of [these instructions](https://github.com/levinunnink/html-form-to-google-sheet).
Cookie implementation was adapted from [this tutorial](https://linuxhint.com/set-check-read-cookie-javascript/).
Lastly, the pie chart was adapted from [this tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/d3-js-pie-function/).

After obtaining the results from various participants, we were able to create the following visualization


#Technical Achievements
-Cookie Feature- Cookies are stored properly so that you have to fill out the cookie on desktop
-Google Sheet Integration- Google Sheet populates with Results: have two different forms, a hidden form for the data we want, the other form is the form you see: Google Sheets make the CSV file a lot more accessible to those wanting to access it.

#Design Achievements
Our visualizations have a prompt where you can input a username that gives the interface a more personal feel. When you log back in, you are prompted with a welcome message and are able to take the trials as many times as you'd like.
