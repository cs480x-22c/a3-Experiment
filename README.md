# Experiment

This experiment was based off of the Cleveland and McGill experiment where the participants were asked to compare two areas and write what percent
the smaller one is of the larger one. Each participant did ~20 runs of the experiment (20 bar charts, 20 pie charts, 20 stacked rectangles) and was
expected to solely use their visual perception of the charts, meaning they weren't allowed to measure the areas in any way. I drew the graphs randomly
every iteration using D3 and then stored the results using Google Forms and a linked Google Sheet. To graph the results, I used Google Sheets API to
access the sheet data using JavaScript, and then I used R and GGPlot2 to create the graph.
