## The Experiment

Link to the Experiment: https://mfaria27.github.io/a3-Experiment/

Inspired by Cleveland and McGill's 1984 paper, this experiement gives multiple testers a set of randomly generated graphs with two of its segments marked. The tester is then asked to determine what percentage the smaller marked segment is of the larger marked segment. For example: If the smaller marked segment looked like it was half the size of the larger one, the tester would input 50 (Meaning 50%). Each participant was given 20 graphs with each graphs type, content, and marks randomized. By the end of the experiment, we would take the participants input responses and compare them to the true percentages calculated for each graph. 

With this experiment, I wanted to test the following hypthesis: Bar charts would be the easiest graph to gauge size differences when not given a y-axis or labels.

To test this, I randomly generated graph content, including: The graph id, which two segments will be marked, the ratio of the smaller mark to the larger mark, and an array of 5-10 random numbers that added up to 100 to be used as percentages. During the experiment, the website would randomly choose between creating either a bar chart, a stacked bar chart, or a pie chart, and then randommly select a graphs content from the previously generated data to create and display a graph. Once each participant completes their experiment, they are presented with a results page that displays the graph type, graph id, their results, and the expected results per graph. The participant would then send those 4 lists (Either copied from the console or the results page) to me for data anaylsis.

The documentation of the graph content generation is in an ipynb Notebook named "makeData.ipynb".
The javascript file "script.js" is not linked to the html file and is just a reference, as linking it causes it to the index causes it to lose some functionality. The script can be found at the bottom of "index.html".

## Results

I had some trouble getting a proper bootstrapped 95% confidence interval on ggplot2, but as these results show, the bar chart did infact had the lowest average error. Pie charts and stacked bar charts were significantly behind the bar chart error, but they weren't to0 far apart from each other.

## Technical Achievements

Complete randomization of almost everything was something that took a lot of time to correctly implement into the experiment. The order of the graphs, which graph type, what data goes into the graph, which segemnts are marked; everything other than the number of graphs displayed was 100% random. Also, the fact that the code makes it so that the graphs content did not need to be altered per graph type was really difficult to implement, so it is very nice seeing that all the website has to do is choose a graph type for a  graph to be generated

## Design Achievements

Creating a canvas that clearly displayed each graph in the exact center of the canvas was quite a design feat (in code that is). You can also resize it to generally everything and the different elements on the page would resize to be better readable. The only thing is the canvas will not change, as having a small canvas makes it difficult to read the graph, so that remained constant

###Also, Thank you Professor Lane for the extension : )
