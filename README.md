## Experiment 
Link: https://jbiss4.github.io/

# Start Page: 
The start page starts with a thank you to those who are completing the experiment and a brief explanation of the goal of what the participant will be doing. Once they click "Start" , it moves on to another page which will depict the Question #, the image, and then a text box which you press "Next" and a new image is generated. On each of these pages there is also the question being asked and an example to explain what you are supposed to do. 

# Bar Graph:
[insert bar here]
The image above depicts an example of one of our randomized bar charts that were generated. Each of the bar graphs had 5 bars, which were randomly generated to have a value between 0 and 100. Then two of these bars were randomly selected (as seen with the two circles) to be compared. 

# Pie Graph:
[insert pie here]
The image above depicts an example of one of our pie charts that were generated. These pie charts had 5 slices, which were randomly generated to have a value between 0 and 100 each. Then two of the slices were randomly selected to be compared. Because we allowed the value to go to 0, there were occasional instances where there would only be 4 slices, and sometimes the circle would end up between two slices to represent that missing slice (and 0% of the larger one).

# Donut Graph:
[insert donut here]
The image above depicts an example of one of our donut charts that were generated. These donut charts had 5 slices, which were randomly generated to have a value between 0 and 100 each. Then two of the slices were randomly selected to be compared. Because we allowed the value to go to 0, there were occasional instances where there would only be 4 slices, and sometimes the circle would end up between two slices to represent that missing slice (and 0% of the larger one). The donut charts very closely resemble the previous pie charts, but without the central area, which could potentially cause it to be more challenging to interpret. 

# Error Graph:

## Hypothesis
Our hypothesis involved trials of three graph types to replicate Cleveland and McGIll's experiment of graphical perception, being a bar graph, a pie graph, and a donut graph. Four our experiment, we hypothesized that the bar graph would be the easiest to percieve size differences in graph elements. While we wanted to compare the bar to both the pie and donut graphs, we wanted to compare the pie graph against the donut graph as they are very similar. We hypothesized that the pie graph would be easier to perceive size differences than the donut graph, since the donut graph has empty space in the middle, meaning it could be harder to determine the true size of the slice and its respective value.

## Results
Our experiment and error conduction showed us that (bar/pie/donut) graph was the best graph when it comes to size perception on graphs. Between the pie and donut graphs, the (pie/donut) graph did better, (as we hypothesized/going against our original hypothesis). ...Talking about the error differences between the bar graph and two circle graphs, and then the circle graphs against each other.

## Technical Achievements
We used d3, html/javascript, google sheets and _ to complete this assignment. 


## Design Achievements
We made sure that there was a counter on the top of the webpage to let the participants know how far they had reached in the experiment. We also made sure that all of our chart types were of a similar size to make sure that the differences between chart types were not due to just having bigger / larger charts. We also edited the formatting, where participants originally had to scroll down to see the image and then scroll up to input the answer, the image and answer box were moved next to one another for easier use. Although with this format it was less accessible to see the counter at the top. Something we could have changed would have been to edit the text box so that it deletes the text inputted after each submission, since participants had to manually erase the data each time and this caused a couple people to accidentally input incorrectly without realizing.
